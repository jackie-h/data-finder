Design

Time series baked in
Model driven - able to swap out backends without changing business logic
Type-safe
Not limited to SQL - ability to express more complex logic
Should not leave your IDE to understand what data is available
Unify querying of live and historical -  streaming



Choosing a Python to SQL query abstraction

Requirements:
Able to provide DB connect and SQL querying.
Should not require full ORM object inflation. Too expensive and we want a dataframe/numpy object anyway
Support for lots of DB dialects and a good abstraction on top of those, Oracle, MySQL and Postgres and Cloud DB's
Support for column based querying - ADBC from Apache Arrow
Support for streaming - ideal
Ideally a Rust backend for Python, not Java or C


Candidates:
SQLAlchemy
Django
PonyORM
PyPika
PeeWee

IBIS - https://ibis-project.org/
uniform python dataframe API with backends for many databases and polars
basic user/password authentication
perhaps too flexible - allows loading and other kinds of API's
hoping to get closer to a direct dataframe, no SQL with

SQLGlot - SQL translator used by IBIS - https://sqlglot.com/sqlglot.html
Has a fast rust SQL parser
Able to translate various database SQL dialects between each other and provides an optimizer
Written in python



A faster SQL parser - written in rust, bindings in Python
