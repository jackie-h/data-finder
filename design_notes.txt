Choosing a Python to SQL query abstraction

Requirements:
Able to provide DB connect and SQL querying.
Should not require full ORM object inflation. Too expensive and we want a dataframe/numpy object anyway
Support for lots of DB dialects and a good abstraction on top of those, Oracle, MySQL and Postgres and Cloud DB's
Support for column based querying - ADBC from Apache Arrow
Support for streaming - ideal
Ideally a Rust backend for Python, not Java or C


Candidates:
SQLAlchemy
Django
PonyORM
PyPika
PeeWee
